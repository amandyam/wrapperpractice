# The wrapper I made was intended to delete files and directories. 
# To use it: 
#     $ ./bashwrapper.sh [NAME OF FILE 1] [NAME OF FILE 2] 
# If you used it properly, you should get an output something like this: 
#     the file you deleted was [NAME OF FILE 1]
# Thank you for looking at my wrapper
