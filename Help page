# The wrapper I made was intended to delete files and directories. 
# To use it: 
#     $ ./bashwrapper.sh [NAME OF FILE 1] [NAME OF FILE 2] 
# If you used it properly, you should get an output something like this: 
#     the file you deleted was [NAME OF FILE 1]
# If you did not use it properly, you will get an output like this: 
#     the file does not exist
# To troubleshoot: 
# 1. Try going to the directory of the file you want to delete
# 2. Try making sure your file name is spelled correctly 
# 3. Make sure the wrapper file is present in your folder
# Thank you for looking at my wrapper
